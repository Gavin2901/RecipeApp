# RecipeApp

First I must note that the repo is not complete as I was unable to push new updates to github after a certain point, explained further in my demo video

- Create and store a recipe
- List your own recipes + other users recipes via toggle switch
- Sign in via your own gmail account or create one for the app
- Update and delete recipes
- Images, Users, and Recipes stores on firebase cloud
- Navigation drawer used to move between pages
